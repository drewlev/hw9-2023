        <h1>About me</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Hi there! I am a senior in college who loves to stay active and explore new places. Some of my favorite hobbies include working out, playing chess, golfing, mountain biking, and traveling. I find that these activities keep me grounded and help me to stay balanced, both physically and mentally.

                When I'm not hitting the gym or the trails, you can usually find me studying or hanging out with friends. I am currently pursuing a degree in [insert major], and I am passionate about [insert field of interest]. I believe that a healthy mind and body are essential for success, and I strive to maintain a balanced lifestyle that allows me to excel both academically and personally.
                
                In my free time, I love to explore new places and experience new cultures. Whether it's hiking through the mountains or trying new foods in a foreign country, I am always up for an adventure. I believe that travel is one of the best ways to broaden your horizons and gain new perspectives on life.
                
                Overall, I am a driven and enthusiastic individual who is always looking for new challenges and experiences. I believe that a healthy, active lifestyle is the key to success, and I strive to maintain that balance in everything that I do.
